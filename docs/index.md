# 📓 Python Microservices Workshop

A hands-on example of 5 Python microservices communicating over REST, with full CRUD operations and SQLite persistence — and an AI coding agent you can use to explore and modify the codebase.

## Services

| Service | Port | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Gateway** | 8000 | Single entry point — routes all requests to the correct service |
| **Users** | 8001 | Create and manage user accounts |
| **Products** | 8002 | Create and manage the product catalog |
| **Inventory** | 8003 | Track stock levels per product |
| **Orders** | 8004 | Place orders — calls Users, Products, and Inventory internally |

Each service is its own container with its own SQLite database file (`/data/*.db`) mounted from a named Docker volume.

## Architecture

```
Client
  │
  ▼
Gateway :8000          ← only port exposed publicly
  │
  ├── /users/*     →  Users Service     :8001  (users.db)
  ├── /products/*  →  Products Service  :8002  (products.db)
  ├── /inventory/* →  Inventory Service :8003  (inventory.db)
  └── /orders/*    →  Orders Service    :8004  (orders.db)
                             │
                             ├── calls Users     (validate user exists)
                             ├── calls Products  (get name + price)
                             └── calls Inventory (reserve stock)
```

When you `POST /orders`, the Orders service makes HTTP calls to the other three services before writing the order — this is the cross-service communication pattern the workshop demonstrates.

## 🤖 Claude AI Agent

Your Dev Spaces workspace includes a Claude AI coding agent connected to this repository. It can read, edit, and commit code — running inside a sandboxed container on the cluster.

### Starting the agent

Click **Terminal** → **Run Task** → **Start Claude AI**.

> Or from the terminal: `python3.11 claude-client/client.py chat`

The agent will:
1. Register you automatically using your workspace username
2. Clone your fork of this repo into its sandbox
3. Drop you into an interactive chat

### How to interact

Type your prompt and press **Enter twice** to submit. The agent streams its response as it works.

```
You: What does the orders service do?

You: Add a /health endpoint to the gateway service and commit it

You: Push my changes and open a draft MR
```

Type `/reset` to clear the conversation history, `/quit` to exit.

### What the agent can do

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `read_file` / `write_file` | Read and edit files in the sandbox |
| `execute_code` | Run Python, Bash, or JavaScript to test changes |
| `git_clone` | Clone your GitLab fork |
| `git_commit` | Stage and commit changes |
| `git_push` | Push to a session branch (`ai/<username>/<timestamp>`) |
| `git_create_mr` | Open a draft Merge Request on GitLab |

### Workflow

```
Dev Spaces (chat)
      │
      │  prompts
      ▼
Claude Agent (Kata sandbox)
      │
      ├── reads/edits files
      ├── runs code to test
      ├── git commit
      └── git push → GitLab MR
                          │
                          ▼
                   Dev Spaces (pull branch, review)
```

The agent always works on a session branch — it never touches `main`.

## Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Services start in dependency order enforced by health checks:

1. Users, Products, Inventory start in parallel
2. Orders starts once all three are healthy
3. Gateway starts once Orders is healthy

Data persists across restarts via named Docker volumes. To wipe all data:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Running Locally (no Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./start-local.sh
```

## End-to-End Demo

With services running, execute the demo script to walk through the full flow:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a user
2. Create a product
3. Add inventory for that product
4. Place an order (triggers cross-service calls)
5. Verify stock was decremented
6. List all orders

## API Reference

Every service exposes a Swagger UI at `/docs`:

- http://localhost:8000/docs — Gateway
- http://localhost:8001/docs — Users
- http://localhost:8002/docs — Products
- http://localhost:8003/docs — Inventory
- http://localhost:8004/docs — Orders

### Example requests (via gateway)

```bash
# Create a user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}'

# Create a product
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Laptop", "description": "Dev machine", "price": 1299.99}'

# Add inventory
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/inventory \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_id": "<product-id>", "quantity": 50, "location": "Warehouse A"}'

# Place an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "<user-id>", "product_id": "<product-id>", "quantity": 2}'
```
